Привіт!
Нещодавно ми реалізували можливість передати свою знижку в вигляді донату на допомогу ЗСУ через наш сервіс.
За 4 місяці багато користувачів hotline.finance підтримали ініціативу.
Кожну зібрану суму ми округляли регулярним платежем від компанії. Таким чином разом нам вдалось зібрати понад півмільйона гривень.
Усі кошти розподілили так:
👉 100 000 грн на президентську ініціативу United24 для формування української армії морських дронів;
👉 125 000 грн у Фонд «Повернись живим»;
👉 285 000 грн у Фонд Ігоря Черненка.
👉 60 000 грн у волонтерську групу «До Мрії».
Якщо цікаво, ось квитанції про переказ коштів: листопад, грудень, січень, лютий.
💪 Нагадуємо, що кожен користувач за бажанням може долучитись до зборів, задонативши свою знижку або бонусні бали одразу при оформленні поліса.
Опція доступна як на сайті, так і в мобільному додатку.
